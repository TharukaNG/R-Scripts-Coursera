## R Markdown

***use of bullet points***
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring:
* HTML
* PDF
* MS Word documents

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

***Another way of adding a link in R markdown - Using embedding***

For more details on using R Markdown click here [link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
